# Maternal Health Ergonomic Interventions Dataset

## Overview
This repository hosts the "Maternal Comfort and Well-being Survey Results" dataset, featuring a total of 75,000 entries aimed at exploring the impact of ergonomic interventions on maternal health during pregnancy. It supports research for developing predictive models to enhance maternal comfort and well-being.

## File Descriptions

### [Complete Dataset]
- **`Maternal_Comfort_Wellbeing_Survey_Results.csv`**: Contains comprehensive data including age, BMI, pregnancy stage, types of ergonomic intervention, and self-reported comfort and well-being levels for 25,000 participants.

### [Validation Dataset]
- **`Maternal_Health_Validation_Dataset.csv`**: Used to fine-tune the models, ensuring they perform well on unseen data, contains the same type of data as the complete dataset for another set of 25,000 participants.

### [Test Dataset]
- **`Maternal_Health_Test_Dataset.csv`**: Employed to evaluate the final model performance to simulate real-world application, includes similar data for an additional 25,000 participants.

## Usage
This dataset is intended for academic researchers and healthcare professionals. It is particularly suited for developing and testing machine learning models focused on assessing and improving health interventions for pregnant women.

## Metrics
- **Comfort Level (1-10)**: Self-reported comfort rating by participants.
- **Well-Being Level (1-10)**: Self-reported well-being rating by participants.
- **Age (years)**: Age of the participants.
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: Body mass index of participants.
- **Pregnancy Stage (weeks)**: Week of pregnancy during the time of the survey.

## Contributing
Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to contribute to this dataset repository by enhancing the dataset, refining models, or extending the analysis related to ergonomic interventions in maternal health.
